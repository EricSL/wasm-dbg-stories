    <h1>Worker stuck in <code>Atomics.wait</code></h1>

    <p>
      This tests that a worker that is stuck in <code>Atomics.wait</code> still has some way to interact
      with the DevTools in a meaningful way. The reason why this is important in the scope of WebAssembly
      is that <code>pthreads</code> are implemented in WebAssembly via workers, and these workers are pooled
      and essentially just sit inside <code>Atomics.wait</code> until a new threads is started via
      <code>pthread_start</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open DevTools</li>
        <li>Reload the page</li>
        <li>Try to open the <code>worker-stuck.js</code> and observe that it doesn't show any contents</li>
        <li>Click <button id='btn'>this button</button></li>
        <li>Suddenly the contents of the file appear</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      const worker = new Worker('worker-stuck.js');
      const buffer = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
      const array = new Int32Array(buffer);
      worker.postMessage({buffer});
      document.querySelector('#btn').onclick = () => {
        Atomics.store(array, 0, 1);
        Atomics.notify(array, 0, 1);
      }
