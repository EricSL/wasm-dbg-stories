    <h1>Files in multiple workers</h1>

    <p>
      This tests that a file that is used in multiple workers appears as a single entity in the developer tools
      to match the workflow for threads that developers are used to from other environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open DevTools</li>
        <li>Open the <code>multi-workers.js</code> on one of the workers</li>
        <li>Reload the page</li>
        <li>You should have only one version of the <code>multi-workers.js</code> file open</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <script>
      for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) new Worker('multi-workers.js');
    </script>
